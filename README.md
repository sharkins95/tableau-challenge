# tableau-challenge
In this project, I worked with 2019 Citi Bike data to analyze multiple topics like who makes up the primary ridership based on qualifiers liek gender and age, where the most and least popular stations are located, what times are the most typical for people to use the bikes, and more. I created multiple graphs, dashboards, and a full story using Tableau to display this data in a visual format that is easy to quickly grasp and understand. These files contain the initial raw data I pulled from Citi Bike that I then saved as a CSV file using Jupyter Notebook.
